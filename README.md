# Client library for The Blue Alliance API v3

This project is largely autogenerated using The Blue Alliance's [API Spec](https://www.thebluealliance.com/swagger/api_v3.json).

## Features/Implementation Notes

* Supports JSON inputs/outputs, File inputs, and Form inputs.
* Supports collection formats for query parameters: csv, tsv, ssv, pipes.
* Some Kotlin and Java types are fully qualified to avoid conflicts with types defined in OpenAPI definitions.
* Implementation of ApiClient is intended to reduce method counts, specifically to benefit Android targets.

## Documentation for Authorization

### apiKey

- **Type**: API key
- **API key parameter name**: X-TBA-Auth-Key

NOTE: The api key is injected by rewriting the RequestConfig class (see [build.gradle](build.gradle#L48-79)). In order to change the api key, edit it in gradle.properties.
