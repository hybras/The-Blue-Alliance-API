# Client library for The Blue Alliance API v3

This project is largely autogenerated using The Blue Alliance's [API Spec](https://www.thebluealliance.com/swagger/api_v3.json). Basic markdown docs are availible in [docs](docs) and are deployed to a [wiki](https://hybras.github.io/The-Blue-Alliance-API/). Fancy html docs from thebluealliance.com [here](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs/v3). The html version lets you try the api out and has a nice ui.

## Features/Implementation Notes

* Supports JSON inputs/outputs, File inputs, and Form inputs.
* Supports collection formats for query parameters: csv, tsv, ssv, pipes.
* Some Kotlin and Java types are fully qualified to avoid conflicts with types defined in OpenAPI definitions.
* Implementation of ApiClient is intended to reduce method counts, specifically to benefit Android targets.

## Documentation for Authorization

### apiKey

* **Type**: API key
* **API key parameter name**: X-TBA-Auth-Key
* **Location**: HTTP header

NOTE: The api key is injected by rewriting the RequestConfig class (see [build.gradle](https://github.com/hybras/The-Blue-Alliance-API/blob/97abaed7255b47a6fde2d7e1e0200d818a07b857/build.gradle#L48-L79)). In order to change the api key, edit it in gradle.properties.
